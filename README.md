# AI Resources

In this repository you will many courses related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I collected from many university.
All Course in this repo just slices about 1-30 lecture.It will help you have basic knowledge about some specific areas.
I hope everyone will like it.
If you find it useful, please give me a star. It will be the motivation for me to continue developing this repo.
If you don't know where to start learning. You can check it out: [AI Roadmap](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#machine-learning-roadmap).
This road will can helps you learn all about ML and DL. You can then go deeper into a specific area
